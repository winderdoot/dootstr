# dootstr

Simple C string library by widerdoot.  
I have no idea how to write markdown files, I'll fix this up as I go.  
There will be documentation here and shit. For now it's a to do list.  

TODO:
slice_view
slice_copy

split() rsplit()
partition() rpartition()
splitlines()
join()
other python like methods

index() => index_c, index

strip(), lstrip(), rstrip()
format()

Probably not gonna implement stuff that would be indentical to an already existing C library function.
At most I might lightly wrap some of them.
