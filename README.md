Simple C string library
I have no idea how to write markdown files, I'll fix this up as I go.

There will be documentation here and shit.

TODO:
slice_view
slice_copy

splitting
python like methods

append
extend
concatenation

Probably not gonna implement stuff that would be indentical to an already existing C library function
